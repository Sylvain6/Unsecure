 > Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. 

### Nothing else to add except useless commands.

```sh
$ cd nastyswaggyshaggydab
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV='No one push in prod'
```

Want to contribute? Great!

### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd nastydab
docker build -t dab/nastyshaggydab:${package.json.version} .
```

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
